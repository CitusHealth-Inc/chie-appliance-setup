## Welcome to Citus Health Integration Engine (CHIE) Appliance Setup

The CHIE helps connect Citus Health cloud servers with customers’ Electronic Health Records (EHR), Revenue Cycle Management (RCM), and other systems behind private firewalls. It acts as a connection engine and gateway between Citus Health applications in the cloud and customers’ local systems.

## Customer Data Input for CHIE Appliance Setup

Please email the following details to the Citus Health Customer Success Team (<customer-success-chie@citushealth.com>):
* GitHub ID (In order to access the CHIE Appliance you should have a GitHub account. If you don't have the Github ID, please create by clicking [here](https://github.com/join))
* GitHub E-mail address
* A Static IP address to the outer firewall of the network where the appliance will be installed. This static IP should route back to the appliance within your network and have ports 22 (SSH) and 443 (HTTPS) open at the firewall so that the Citus Health Customer Success Team can access the server remotely.

As part of your initial onboarding we will probably already have the details below, which we will be using for the initial set up activities. If you need to change any of these details for this setup please feel free to mention in the email.

 - Name of the Company/Organization
 - Communication Address

Once the Citus Health Customer Success team receives the e-mail, we will send you instructions and credentials for how to install the CHIE Virtual Machine as an appliance.
