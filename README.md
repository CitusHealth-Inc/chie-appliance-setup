## Welcome to Citus Health Integration Engine (CHIE) Appliance Setup

The CHIE helps connect Citus Health cloud servers with customers’ Electronic Health Records (EHR), Revenue Cycle Management (RCM), and other systems behind private firewalls. It acts as a connection engine and gateway between Citus Health applications in the cloud and customers’ local systems.

## Customer Data Input for CHIE Appliance Setup

Please email the following details to the Citus Health Customer Success Team (<customer-success-chie@citushealth.com>)

* GitHub E-mail address
* A Static IP address to the outer firewall of the network where the appliance will be installed (to register the DNS server and certificate to access the CHIE appliance infrastructure using HTTPS). This static IP should route back to the appliance within your network and have ports 22 and 443 open at the firewall so that the Citus Health Customer Success Team can access the server remotely.

We already have the below details which we will be using for the initial set up activities like domain URL for verification setup, account name. If you need to change any of these details for this setup please feel free to mention in the email.

Once the Citus Health Customer Success team receives the e-mail, we will send you instructions and credentials for how to install the CHIE Virtual Machine as an appliance.
